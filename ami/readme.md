# Generic CI operation | AMI
## Introduction 
 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline enhances the automation and efficiency of deploying applications in a cloud environment. This integration ensures that the process of building, testing, and deploying AMIs is seamless, reliable, and repeatable.

## What is AMI 
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template for your instances. It includes the following components:

Operating System: Such as Linux, Windows, or macOS.

Application Server: Pre-installed server software like Apache, Nginx, or IIS.

Applications: Pre-configured software and applications tailored for specific tasks or environments.

AMI using CI refers to the practice of integrating the creation and maintenance of AMIs into a CI/CD pipeline. This process automates the building, testing, and deployment of AMIs, ensuring that they are consistently updated and compliant with the latest application and infrastructure requirements.

## Why 
* Automation: Automates the creation, testing, and deployment of AMIs, reducing manual effort and errors.

* Consistency: Ensures that AMIs are consistently built and deployed with the same configuration.

* Speed: Accelerates the deployment process by integrating AMI creation into the CI pipeline.

* Quality: Enhances the reliability and quality of AMIs through automated testing and validation.

* Scalability: Easily scale the deployment of applications across multiple instances with consistent AMIs.
